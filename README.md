# GifHomework

This application has a set list of buttons which on click add a list of 10 gifs in cards from the GIPHY api that fit the search term listed on the button.  It also shows the rating of the GIF below

There is also a button adder feature which will create a new button (and append it with the other buttons).  These added buttons will also call the GIPHY API and return 10 gifs using the button title/tag that was entered.

The button adding does not happen exacly as described in the documentation - rather than adding to the topics array I just created/appended new buttons to the same area.
